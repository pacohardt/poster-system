# poster-system
This is an experimental tool.Apart from standard functions of text and image manipulation, poster.system introduces randomize features that let users easily create compositions and play with different layouts. 

Upload your own images/.txt files or load them randomly from the Lorem Picusm and Hipster Ipsum API.

# the code, open design and more
I decided to share the full code behind the tool, between many other reasons as a way to give something back to the creative coding community.
While developing this tool, a couple of updates for P5js came out that would've made the code and the tool itself run much smoother. I consciously decided to keep on with the (at the time current) limitations, which also forced me to approach the issues and challenges by myself. On that note, I am also aware of not only perforamnce problems but also other general code readability and structure issues! This tool has been a way for me to learn more about what I can do and what I still have to learn! So please feel free to point out any issues or suggestions, I will look into them as far as I am capable to.
